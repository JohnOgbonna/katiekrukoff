This is a simple react frontend project of a port-folio for my friend, Katie Krukoff:

This project consists of three pages, the landing page, dance page, and work/professional page

On the work page, you can view her skills and download her latest resume

On the dance page, you can view recent photos of her dancing and see what she has been up to. 

The website features a teal color base, her favourite color!

Fully responsive, custom Ui, styled with SCSS
